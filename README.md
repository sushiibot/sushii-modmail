## Features

Focused on simplicity and user experience, sushii-modmail provides:

- **Built-in Organization and Archive** - ModMail threads are Forum channel
  threads. Forum tags are used so you can only show the threads that are
  currently open. No more worrying about losing thread history if the bot goes
  offline or if you need to change to a different bot.
- **Configurable Message** - Initial message sent to the user when they open a
  thread.
- **Configurable Notifications** - Ping roles when a new thread is opened,
  optionally a silent ping.
- **Snippets** - Re-usable messages for common responses. Snippets can be
  configured to be anonymous or not.
- **Anonymous Replies** - Keep staff members anonymous when replying.
- **Easy Setup** - No need for a web server or separate database.

## Commands

General
- `settings` - Setup, view, and change bot settings.

Thread
- `contact` - Open a new thread with a user (if staff wants to contact user)
- `reply` - Reply to a thread.
- `areply` - Anonymously reply to a thread.
- `preply` - Plain text reply to a thread.
- `apreply` - Anonymous plain text reply to a thread.
- `edit` - Edit a previous thread message, reply to the message you want to edit.
- `delete` - Delete a previous thread message, reply to the message you want to delete.
- `close` - Close the current thread.

User information
- `logs` - Links to previous threads by the same user.

Snippets
- `snippet add [name] [content]` - Create a new snippet
- `snippet edit [name] [content]` - Modify an existing snippet
- `snippet [name]` - Show a snippet's content
- `snippet list` - List all available snippets
- `snippet delete [name]` - Delete a snippet

## Notes on design choices

- This bot intentionally does not use slash commands for ease of use.
- Closing threads does **not** send anything to the user. Since the user only
  sees a DM with the bot, there isn't anything being "closed" or changed for
  them. Closing threads only changes things on the staff side, so it doesn't
  make sense to show the user anything.

## Usage

You can run sushii-modmail with Docker and uses SQLite as the database so there
is no need to run a separate database server.

Images are built and published to [Github container registry](https://github.com/sushiibot/sushii-modmail/pkgs/container/modmail)

Images contain a [Litestream](https://litestream.io/) binary for automatic
replication of the SQLite database to a remote S3-compatible storage. This is
not enabled by default, but can be optionally enabled configured. A
[default Litestream configuration](./litestream.yml) file is included in the
image, but you can override it by mounting your own configuration file at
`/etc/litestream.yml` in the container.

Example Docker compose file with all the environment variables

```yml
services:
  modmail:
    name: sushii-modmail
    image: ghcr.io/sushiibot/modmail:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      # Directory to store database
      - ./data:/app/data

      # If you want to override the default Litestream config, you can mount
      # your own, otherwise it will use the default config ./litestream.yml
      # and use environment variables below
      # https://litestream.io/reference/config/
      - ./litestream.yml:/etc/litestream.yml
    environment:
      #  Base settings
      - LOG_LEVEL=info
      - DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
      - DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
      - DATABASE_URI=/app/data/db.sqlite

      # Required Settings
      - MAIL_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id

      # Litestream configuration
      - REPLICATE_DB=true # Optional, default is false
      # Restore if DB not found
      - RESTORE_DB=true # Optional, default is false

      - LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID=s3-access-key-id
      - LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=s3-secret-access-key
      - LITESTREAM_BUCKET=bucket-name
      - LITESTREAM_PATH=path/within/bucket
      - LITESTREAM_ENDPOINT=s3-endpoint
      - LITESTREAM_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true # Optional, default is false, some S3 providers require this
```

Once the bot is running, you can use the `settings` command to set up additional
configuration, such as the channel to use for ModMail threads, roles that can
use the bot, and more.

## Development

sushii-modmail uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for development and runtime.

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run tests
bun test

# Start the bot
bun start
```
